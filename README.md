## Overview

Maintained fork of [influxdb-relay][overview-href] originally developed by
InfluxData. Replicate InfluxDB data for high availability.

## Description

This project adds a basic high availability layer to InfluxDB. With the right
architecture and disaster recovery processes, this achieves a highly available
setup.

## Tested on

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.7.4 to 1.11.2
- [InfluxDB](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.6/introduction/installation/) 1.6.4 to 1.7

Other versions will probably work but are untested.

## Setup

### Go

Download the daemon into your `$GOPATH` and install it in `/sur/sbin`.

```sh
go get -u github.com/vente-privee/influxdb-relay
cp ${GOPATH}/bin/influxdb-relay /usr/bin/influxdb-relay
chmod 755 /usr/bin/influxdb-relay
```

Create the configuration file in `/etc/influxdb-relay`.

```sh
mkdir -p /etc/influxdb-relay
cp ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/vente-privee/influxdb-relay/examples/sample.conf \
   /etc/influxdb-relay/influxdb-relay.conf
```

### Docker

Build your own image.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:vente-privee/influxdb-relay
cd influxdb-relay
docker build \
       --file Dockerfile \
       --rm \
       --tag influxdb-relay:latest \
       .
docker run \
       --volume /path/to/influxdb-relay.conf:/etc/influxdb-relay/influxdb-relay.conf
       --rm
       influxdb-relay:latest
```

or

Docker pull our image.

```sh
docker pull vptech/influxdb-relay:latest
docker run \
       --volume /path/to/influxdb-relay.conf:/etc/influxdb-relay/influxdb-relay.conf
       --rm
       vptech/influxdb-relay:latest
```

InfluxDB Relay is able to forward from a variety of input sources, including:

* `influxdb`
* `prometheus`

### Administrative tasks

#### /admin endpoint

Whereas data manipulation relies on the `/write` endpoint, some other features
such as database or user management are based on the `/query` endpoint. As
InfluxDB Relay does not send back a response body to the client(s), we are not
able to forward all of the features this endpoint provides. Still, we decided
to expose it through the `/admin` route.

It is now possible to query the `/admin` endpoint. Its usage is the same as the
standard `/query` Influx DB enpoint:

```
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:9096/admin" --data-urlencode 'q=CREATE DATABASE some_database'
```

Errors will be logged just like regular `/write` queries. The HTTP response
bodies will not be forwarded back to the clients.

#### /health endpoint

This endpoint provides a quick way to check the state of all the backends.
It will return a JSON object detailing the status of the backends like this : 

```json
{
  "status": "problem",
  "problem": {
    "local-influxdb01": "KO. Get http://influxdb/ping: dial tcp: lookup influxdb on 0.0.0.0:8086: no such host"
  },
  "healthy": {
    "local-influxdb02": "OK. Time taken 3ms"
  }
}
```

If the relay encounters an error while checking a backend, this backend will be reported with the associated error in the `problems` object.
The backends wich the relay was able to communicate with will be reported in the healthy object.

The status field is a summary of the general state of the backends, the defined states are as follows:
* `healthy`: no errors were encountered
* `problem`: some backends, but no all of them, returned errors
* `critical`: every backend returned an error

### Filters

We allow tags and measurements filtering through regular expressions. Please,
take a look at [this document](docs/filters.md) for more information.

## Limitations

So far, this is compatible with Debian, RedHat, and other derivatives.

## Development
